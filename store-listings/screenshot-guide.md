### Editing Tips

## Example Screenshot Flow

### For a reviewer/user viewing your listing:

1. **Screenshot 1:** "Oh, there's a button that appears on decklist pages"
2. **Screenshot 2:** "And it exports the deck to Fabrary - that's exactly what I need!"
3. **Screenshot 3 (optional):** "I can even see the technical details if needed"

This tells a complete story in 2-3 images.
